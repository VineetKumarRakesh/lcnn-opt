## 🧰 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VineetKumarRakesh/lcnn-opt.git
cd lcnn-opt
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate lcnn-opt
```

> 🧪 Tested on PyTorch 2.5.1 + CUDA 12.6 with NVIDIA L40s (but works on lesser mortals too)

---

## 🏋️ Train a Model

```bash
python train.py --model repvgg_a2 --config configs/repvgg.yaml --amp
```

* Use `--amp` for mixed precision.  
* Use `--log` to save your training logs to `/outputs/`.

---

## 🧪 Evaluate a Model

```bash
python eval.py --checkpoint outputs/repvgg_best.pt --data-path /path/to/imagenet-val
```

Want to recreate the full ablation madness?

```bash
python scripts/ablation_study.py --config configs/convnext.yaml
```
